# NBA Players statistics
## A fun personal project.

This is a fun project I created to visualize some statistics of NBA players in the current season, after learning some Selenium and Python Dash.

Feel free to clone this repo and have a play about. You can recreate the environment using conda by opening a terminal in the cloned project and typing

`conda env create -f nba_env.yml'

Cheers!
